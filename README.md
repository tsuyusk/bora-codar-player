Sup!
This repo contains the code of the first challenge of "Bora Codar" event from rocketseat
The challenge consists of cloning [this interface](https://www.figma.com/file/jHSpzsQYp453QTmxJsae3l/boraCodar-Desafio-1-Copy?fuid=827675393442215472)

It was a fun challenge (:
Some of the features I included are:
- Pretty hovers and animations
- The progerss bar grows throughout the time!
- The player has functional buttons!

All of that with extremely well separated concerns inside the application (:
Feel free to point anything I could improve in the code!
